# [[scaffold .Project scaffold]]

Built with Vben Admin, Vue 3, and Ant Design Vue 4, integrated with Go-Cinch
chi-auth-layout.

Run these commands from the generated project root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
AUTH_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8080 pnpm dev
pnpm check:type
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Requires Node.js `^22.18.0 || ^24.12.0` and pnpm `11.16.0`.
The application lives in `apps/web-antd`; `packages` and `internal` provide
shared components and build tools. Dependencies are installed after generation;
node_modules and package manager caches are not part of the template.

The development browser API base defaults to `/api/auth`. Set `AUTH_PROXY_TARGET`
to your backend URL during development, either in the shell or in
`apps/web-antd/.env.development.local`. When unset, use an external gateway.
Vite removes the outer `/api/auth` prefix, forwarding `/api/auth/auth/pub/login`
to `/auth/pub/login` and `/api/auth/user` to `/user`, preserving backend module
paths without colliding with frontend routes such as `/auth/login`.

For production, replace `auth-service:8080` in `scripts/deploy/nginx.conf` with
your upstream service address. Keep the trailing `/` in `proxy_pass`.
Build output is written to `apps/web-antd/dist`. Production
`VITE_GLOB_API_URL` and `VITE_GLOB_AUTH_API_URL` default to
`https://entry.go-cinch.top/api/auth`; rebuild after changing either value.

Mock services are disabled. The application uses frontend menus and backend
permissions. Backend menu mode requires a custom `/menu/all` endpoint.
Run existing tests with `pnpm test:unit`. Vben's original MIT notice is
available in `LICENSE_VBEN`.
